    <h1>aosd</h1>

    <p> This page is now (or soon to be) obsolete. You probably want
    to be <a href=http://aosd.sourceforge.net/>here</a>.

<hr>

    <p> A long, long time ago (2002), I wrote a little utility that
    used xosd and ALSA events to show volume bars whenever the volume
    changed (I was trying to make my desktop pretty). See <a
    href=alsa-xosd.png>the screenshot</a> for a better idea. I threw
    up the source code on my web page, with no project web page, and
    essentially no documentation. I then forgot all about it, and the
    code began to bit rot. To my great surprise, someone found it, and
    used it. Indeed, when the xosd API changed, Marek Szuba of CERN
    sent a patch (2008) to make aosd work again. In response to the
    patch, I created this page. 

    <p> Shortly thereafter, Marek generously agreed to continue
    maintaining aosd, so future updates will be on his <a
    href=http://aosd.sourceforge.net/>aosd web page</a> on
    SourceForge. I rather prefer when things on the Internet don't
    disappear, so this page will stay around for historical reasons.

    <p> You can download:
    <ul> 
    <li> The latest aosd from <a
    href=http://aosd.sourceforge.net/>Sourceforge</a>
    <li> Marek's <a href=aosd-patched.c>patched version</a> of aosd. 
    <li> My <a href=aosd-original.c>original version</a> of aosd and
    Marek's <a href=aosd.c-newlibver.patch>patch</a> individually. 
    <li> My original <a href=readme.txt>README</a> file
    </ul>

    <p> These should compile with the command: 
    <pre>gcc aosd.c -lxosd -lasound -oaosd</pre>

    <p> I have not tested Marek's patch, since I no longer use aosd
    myself, but I did read it to confirm that it contains no hostile
    code.
